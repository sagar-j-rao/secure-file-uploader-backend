# Secure File Uploader â€“ Backend (Node.js + Express)

This backend handles signed S3 URL generation for secure file uploads and downloads. Used in combination with the Angular frontend.

### ðŸ’¡ Why itâ€™s cool:

- Files are **private by default**
- Sharing works only via temporary signed links
- Backend never stores the file â€” itâ€™s all on AWS S3

## âœ¨ Features

- `POST /generate-upload-url`  
  Returns a pre-signed URL to upload a file directly to S3

- `GET /generate-download-url?filename=xyz.pdf`  
  Returns a secure download link, valid for 15 mins
